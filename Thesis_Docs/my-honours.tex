% Abstract

\prefacesection{Abstract}

This thesis is a coherent presentation of a quest to generalise three classical
theorems that were discovered in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Their analogues are
the product of a conglomeration of ideas that straddle the 1980s and 1990s and
the application of these new results brings the story into the twenty-first
century.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{s-intro}

\section{Overview}\label{overview}



{\noindent} Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (SVD) describes a set of abnormalities affecting small blood vessels in the deep grey and white matter of the brain. The changes are particularly prevalent amongst the elderly, with SVD biomarkers appearing in over 90\% of MRI for those aged 60-90 years \cite{deLeeuwF-E2001Pocw}. SVD is the primary cause of over one fifth of ischaemic (oxygen-starved) strokes \cite{SmithStephen2002ARaA} and is a major cause of dementia and cognitive decline \cite{NorrvingBo2008Linb}.

Imaging markers of SVD include lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces, white matter hyperintensities, microbleeds, recent small subcortical infarcts and brain atrophy \cite{WardlawJ.M.2013Nsfr}.


%Current research into SVD (EXPAND):

Current research is investigating the role that each feature plays in SVD. It is not clear the extent to which SVD affects cognition, or which events are to blame, so there is the need to differentiate between features.

Current feature identification is conducted either by eye (rating) or using computational algorithms. 

Rating by eye is conducted in accordance to STRIVE criterion. Lacunes are defined as ...

Perivascular spaces are ...

% Rating by eye consistency

\section{Results}\label{results}








Lacunes are ovoid fluid-filled cavities, between 3mm to 15mm in diameter. In MRI, lacunes return a similar signal intensity to that of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).


In accordance to the standardised definitions specified by the STRIVE criterion \cite{WardlawJ.M.2013Nsfr}, lacunes are 


Perivascular spaces are small areas of the brain filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) due to brain shrinkage.

Current studies are current uncertain about the impact of perivascular spaces on cognitive decline, in particular the comparison against lacunes. A paper discusses that PVS are not causes of decline, and that other studies only give PVS significance since they are difficult to distinguish from lacunes.

Current methods for feature identification include rating by eye, or utilising a program to automate the process.
