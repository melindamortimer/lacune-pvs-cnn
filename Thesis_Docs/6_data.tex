\chapter{The Data}\label{model}

\section{The Data}

Where the data came from. The MRI source, type of images, with wavelengths etc. Similar description to Ghafoorian's (Section 2.1). Any preprocessing.

What the samples were. E.g. 51x51 patches. Number of training, validation, testing.

Show some example images, alongside their classification.

The system that the models were built under - built in R using a tensorflow API. Models were run on dedicated servers.

%\section{First Model Structure}
%
%Code in Appendix.
%
%Purpose was to have a point of comparison against the model built by Ghafoorian et al. \cite{GhafoorianM.2017Dml3}.
%
%Brief outline of structure.
%
%Different number of samples. Far fewer lacunes in our dataset. Paper had 2/3 negaatives, 1/3 positives. Our data consists of just under 10\% positives. Proposed model paper had 320K total samples. Our data has 50K, far fewer samples than the proposed model.
%
%In addition, around the 11th epoch, the training accuracy drops from near 100\% to near 0\%. This could be since the cross entropy has a log, and the algorithm attempts to take log(0). Introduce a small constant to achieve log(y + 1e-10).
%Getting NANs from the cross entropy function.
%
%
%\section{Proposed Model Structure}
%
%Code in Appendix.
%
%Explain structure of model, including diagram similar to that from Ghafoorian. Number of layers, number of neurons in each layer. What each layer was and the order. Method for chosen hyper-parameters.
