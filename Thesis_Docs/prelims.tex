% Abstract

\prefacesection{Abstract}

Cerebral small vessel disease is a neurological disease that affects over 90\% of elderly and is a major cause of strokes, dementia and cognitive decline. Biomarkers of the disease are visible in \textsc{mri} and are manually identified by trained clinicians. Lacunes are one such biomarker and are of particular interest for their potential role in the advancement of cerebral small vessel disease and in the incidence of stroke. However, the identification of lacunes is difficult, laborious, and largely inconsistent.

In this thesis, we present an automated convolutional neural networks model for the identification of lacunes. The model is adapted from an existing lacune identification model by Ghafoorian et al. \cite{GhafoorianM.2017Dml3}, whilst presenting vast simplifications. In particular, we perform extraction of the brain matter prior to modelling and remove the dependence on location-based variables. The resulting model exhibits a testing sensitivity of 99.9\% and specificity of 99.8\%.

%This thesis is a coherent presentation of a quest to generalise three classical
%theorems that were discovered in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Their analogues are
%the product of a conglomeration of ideas that straddle the 1980s and 1990s and
%the application of these new results brings the story into the twenty-first
%century.
