% Abstract

\prefacesection{Abstract}

Cerebral small vessel disease is a neurological disease that affects over 90\% of elderly and is a major cause of stroke, dementia and cognitive decline. Biomarkers of the disease are visible in \textsc{mri} and are manually identified by trained clinicians. Lacunes are one such biomarker and are of particular interest for their potential role in the advancement of cerebral small vessel disease and in the incidence of stroke. However, the manual identification of lacunes is difficult, laborious, and largely inconsistent.

In this thesis, we present a convolutional neural networks model for the automated detection of lacunes in \textsc{mri}. The model is adapted from an existing model by Ghafoorian et al. \cite{GhafoorianM.2017Dml3}, whilst making vast simplifications. In particular, we perform extraction of the brain matter prior to modelling and remove the dependence on location-based variables. The resulting model exhibits a testing sensitivity of 99.9\% and a specificity of 99.8\%.
