% Abstract

\prefacesection{Abstract}

%This thesis is a coherent presentation of a quest to generalise three classical
%theorems that were discovered in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Their analogues are
%the product of a conglomeration of ideas that straddle the 1980s and 1990s and
%the application of these new results brings the story into the twenty-first
%century.
