% Abstract

\prefacesection{Abstract}

This thesis is a coherent presentation of a quest to generalise three classical
theorems that were discovered in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Their analogues are
the product of a conglomeration of ideas that straddle the 1980s and 1990s and
the application of these new results brings the story into the twenty-first
century.
