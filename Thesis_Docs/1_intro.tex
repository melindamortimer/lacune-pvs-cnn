\chapter{Introduction}\label{s-intro}

{\noindent} Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (\textsc{svd}) describes a set of abnormalities affecting small blood vessels in the deep grey and white matter of the brain. The changes are particularly prevalent amongst the elderly, with \textsc{svd} biomarkers appearing in over 90\% of \textsc{mri} for those aged 60--90 years \cite{deLeeuwF-E2001Pocw}. \textsc{svd} is the primary cause of a quarter of ischaemic (oxygen-starved) strokes \cite{WardlawJ.M.2013Nsfr} and is a major cause of dementia and cognitive decline \cite{NorrvingBo2008Linb}.

Imaging markers of \textsc{svd} include lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces, white matter hyperintensities, microbleeds, recent small subcortical infarcts and brain atrophy \cite{WardlawJ.M.2013Nsfr}. Current research is investigating the role of particular biomarkers in the advancement of \textsc{svd}. Currently, it is not clear the extent to which \textsc{svd} affects cognition, or which events in particular are to blame. Consequently, there is the need for clear identification of biomarkers to ensure accurate analysis.

The identification of \textsc{svd} biomarkers in \textsc{mri} (known as image \textit{rating}) is generally conducted by eye. The 3D image constructed by an \textsc{mri} scan is made up of numerous 2D slices. Trained clinicians, with reference to the \textsc{strive} criterion \cite{WardlawJ.M.2013Nsfr}, examine each image slice for lesions and other features of interest. The locations and sizes of these features are logged manually.

Some neuroscientists have commented on the difficulty and reliability of these rating methods. Wardlaw et al. \cite{WardlawJm2013Mosc} advised caution when making conclusions as many of the features are difficult to identify. This was especially the case for research coordinated prior to 2013, before the \textsc{strive} criterion was established \cite{WardlawJ.M.2013Nsfr}.

Several attempts have been made to improve the reliability of visual rating, with moderate success \cite{AdamsH.H.Hieab2013RMfD, PotterGillian2015CPSV}. However intra-rater and inter-rater percentage agreements are still low for brain regions with a higher frequency of lacunes and perivascular spaces, such as the basal ganglia. In the trial by Potter et al. \cite{PotterGillian2015CPSV},  the intra-rater and inter-rater agreements for the basal ganglia were 0.54--0.68 and 0.65--0.77 respectively. This was considered an improvement, however the extent of the remaining inconsistencies means that caution must be taken when drawing conclusions.

Lacunes are of particular interest as the role of lacunes and perivascular spaces in \textsc{svd} symptoms is still under consideration. In one instance, Benjamin et al. \cite{BenjaminJ.Philip2018LIbN} argue that it is only lacunes, rather than perivascular spaces, that influence cognitive decline. They suspect that previous observed influence of perivascular spaces may have been the result of incorrect classification during the rating process.

To allow for more accurate, efficient and consistent image rating of lacunes and perivascular spaces, this paper attempts to automate the process via machine learning.

Previous attempts at automated lacune detection in \textsc{mri} have had mixed results. In 2007, Yokoyama et al. \cite{Yokoyama2007} determined candidate lacunes by considering the candidate's distance to the cerebral ventricles, which are located at the centre of the brain. False-positives were reduced by developing thresholds on the candidates' area, perimeter, and centre of gravity. The model had a lacune sensitivity of 90.1\%, specificity of 30.0\% and had an average of 1.7 false-positives per image slice. Also in 2007, Uchiyama et al. \cite{Uchiyama2007b, Uchiyama20071554} used the method developed by Yokoyama et al., and additionally reduced false-positives by feeding twelve features into two machine learning models: a support vector machine and a neural network. The resulting models had a sensitivity of 96.8\%, and had an average of 0.76 false-positives per slice. These models were revised in 2015 \cite{Uchiyama2015}, with false-positives reduced by matching candidate lacunes with image templates. The resulting model had a sensitivity of 96.8\% with 0.47 false-positives per slice. In 2017, Ghafoorian et al. \cite{GhafoorianM.2017Dml3} developed a convolutional neural networks method. This model exhibited a sensitivity of 97.4\% with an average of 0.13 false-positives per slice.

Chapter 2 is an introduction to the terminology surrounding \textsc{mri} and the biomakers involved in \textsc{svd}. Chapter 3 is an introduction to the workings, structure and equations behind neural networks. Chapter 4 introduces convolutional neural network structure.
