\chapter{Introduction}\label{s-intro}

{\noindent} Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (SVD) describes a set of abnormalities affecting small blood vessels in the deep grey and white matter of the brain. The changes are particularly prevalent amongst the elderly, with SVD biomarkers appearing in over 90\% of MRI for those aged 60-90 years \cite{deLeeuwF-E2001Pocw}. SVD is the primary cause of over one fifth of ischaemic (oxygen-starved) strokes \cite{SmithStephen2002ARaA} and is a major cause of dementia and cognitive decline \cite{NorrvingBo2008Linb}.

Imaging markers of SVD include lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces, white matter hyperintensities, microbleeds, recent small subcortical infarcts and brain atrophy \cite{WardlawJ.M.2013Nsfr}.

Current research is investigating the role of particular biomarkers in the advancement of SVD. Currently, it is not clear the extent to which SVD affects cognition, or which events are to blame. Consequently, there is the need for clear identification of biomarkers to ensure accurate analysis can be made.

The identification of SVD biomarkers in MRI (rating) is generally conducted by eye. The 3D image constructed by an MRI scan is made up of numerous 2D slices. Trained clinicians, with reference to STRIVE criterion \cite{WardlawJ.M.2013Nsfr}, examine each image slice for lesions and other features of interest. The coordinates and sizes of these features are logged manually.

However, some neuroscientists have commented on the difficulty and reliability of these rating methods. Wardlaw et al. \cite{WardlawJm2013Mosc} advised caution when making conclusions as many of the features are difficult to identify. This was especially the case for research coordinated prior to 2013, before the STRIVE criterion was established \cite{WardlawJ.M.2013Nsfr}.

Several attempts have been made to improve the reliability of visual rating, with moderate success \cite{AdamsH.H.Hieab2013RMfD, PotterGillian2015CPSV}. However intra-rater and inter-rater percentage agreements are still low for brain regions with a higher frequency of lacunes and perivascular spaces, such as the basal ganglia. In the trial by Potter et al. \cite{PotterGillian2015CPSV},  the intra-rater and inter-rater agreements for the basal ganglia were 0.54-0.68 and 0.65-0.77 respectively. This was considered an improvement, however the extent of the remaining inconsistencies means that caution must be taken when drawing conclusions.

Lacunes are of particular interest as the role of lacunes and perivascular spaces is still under consideration. In one instance, Benjamin et al. \cite{BenjaminJ.Philip2018LIbN} argue that it is only lacunes, rather than perivascular spaces, that influence cognitive decline. They suspect that previous observed influence of perivascular spaces may have been the result of incorrect classification during the rating process.

To allow for more accurate, efficient and consistent image rating of lacunes and perivascular spaces, this paper attempts to automate the process via machine learning.

Previous attempts at automated lacune detection in \textsc{mri} have had mixed results. In 2007, Yokoyama et al. \cite{Yokoyama2007} determined candidates via multiphase binarisation. To reduce false positives, they developed thresholds on candidate area, perimeter, and centre of gravity. Also in 2007, Uchiyama et al. \cite{Uchiyama20071554, Uchiyama2007b} used the method developed by Yokoyama et al., and additionally reduced false positives by feeding 12 features into support vector machines and neural networks. These models were revised in 2015\cite{Uchiyama2015}, with reduced false-positives via template matching.

In 2017, Ghafoorian et al. \cite{GhafoorianM.2017Dml3} developed a convolutional neural networks method. As with previous models, this model is dependent on input location variables for false positive reduction. 

Chapter 2 is an introduction to the terminology surrounding MRI and the biomakers involved in SVD. Chapter 3 is an introduction to the workings, structure and equations behind neural networks. Chapter 4 introduces convolutional neural network structure.
