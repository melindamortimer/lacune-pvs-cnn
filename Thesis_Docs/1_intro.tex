\chapter{Introduction}\label{s-intro}

{\noindent} Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (\textsc{svd}) describes a set of abnormalities affecting small blood vessels in the deep grey and white matter of the brain. The changes are particularly prevalent amongst the elderly, with \textsc{svd} biomarkers appearing in over 90\% of \textsc{mri} for those aged 60--90 years \citep{deLeeuwF-E2001Pocw}. \textsc{svd} is the primary cause of a quarter of ischaemic (oxygen-starved) strokes \citep{WardlawJ.M.2013Nsfr} and is a major cause of dementia and cognitive decline \citep{NorrvingBo2008Linb}.

Imaging markers of \textsc{svd} include lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces, white matter hyperintensities, microbleeds, recent small subcortical infarcts and brain atrophy \citep{WardlawJ.M.2013Nsfr}. Current research is investigating the role of particular biomarkers in the advancement of \textsc{svd}. Currently, it is not clear the extent to which \textsc{svd} affects cognition, or which events in particular are to blame. Consequently, there is the need for clear identification of biomarkers to ensure accurate analysis.

The identification of \textsc{svd} biomarkers in \textsc{mri} (known as image \textit{rating}) is generally conducted by eye. The three-dimensional image constructed by an \textsc{mri} scan is made up of numerous two-dimensional \textit{slices}. Trained clinicians, with reference to the \textsc{strive} criterion \citep{WardlawJ.M.2013Nsfr}, examine each image slice for lesions and other features of interest. The locations and sizes of these features are logged manually, and is therefore a very time consuming task. \cite{Heuvel2016} claim that the rating of a single brain scan takes approximate one hour.

Additionally, neuroscientists have commented on the difficulty and reliability of these rating methods. \cite{WardlawJm2013Mosc} advised caution when making conclusions as many of the features are difficult to identify. This was especially the case for research coordinated prior to 2013, before the \textsc{strive} criterion was established \citep{WardlawJ.M.2013Nsfr}.

Several attempts have been made to improve the reliability of visual rating, with moderate success \citep{AdamsH.H.Hieab2013RMfD, PotterGillian2015CPSV}. However intra-rater and inter-rater percentage agreements are still low for brain regions with a higher frequency of lacunes and perivascular spaces, such as the basal ganglia. In the trial by \cite{PotterGillian2015CPSV},  the intra-rater and inter-rater agreements for the basal ganglia were 0.54--0.68 and 0.65--0.77 respectively. This was considered an improvement, however the extent of the remaining inconsistencies means that caution must be taken when drawing conclusions.

Lacunes are of particular interest as the role of lacunes and perivascular spaces in \textsc{svd} symptoms is still under consideration. In one instance, \cite{BenjaminJ.Philip2018LIbN} argue that it is only lacunes, rather than perivascular spaces, that influence cognitive decline. They suspect that previous observed influence of perivascular spaces may have been the result of incorrect classification during the rating process.

Attempts at improving the accuracy, efficiency and consistency of image rating has been undertaken through the use of automation. In 2007, \cite{Yokoyama2007} determined candidate lacunes by considering the candidate's distance to central structures of the brain. False-positives were reduced by developing thresholds on the candidates' area, perimeter, and centre of gravity. The model had a lacune sensitivity of 90.1\%, specificity of 30.0\% and had an average of 1.7 false-positives per image slice. Also in 2007, \cite{Uchiyama20071554, Uchiyama2007b} used the method developed by \cite{Yokoyama2007}, and additionally reduced false-positives by feeding twelve additional variables into two machine learning models: a support vector machine and a neural network. The resulting models had a sensitivity of 96.8\%, and had an average of 0.76 false-positives per slice. These models were revised in 2015 \citep{Uchiyama2015}, with false-positives reduced by matching candidate lacunes with image templates. The resulting model had a sensitivity of 96.8\% with 0.47 false-positives per slice. The sensitivities of these models are moderately high and demonstrate efficacy at identifying lacunes, however they require further improvement before they can be implemented fully.

Improvement in image classification accuracy was made with the introduction of convolutional neural networks (\textsc{cnn}s). In 2012, the AlexNet \textsc{cnn} model \citep{AlexNet2012} performed the best of all model entries on the ImageNet data set, which contains $1.5\times10^{7}$ images from $2.2\times10^5$ categories. In 2016, a \textsc{cnn} was implemented for \textsc{mri} classification and used to successfully detect cerebral microbleeds \citep{DouQ.2016ADoC}. In 2017, \cite{GhafoorianM.2017Dml3} developed a \textsc{cnn} for the detection of lacunes, using additional location-based variables and three-dimensional \textsc{cnn}s. This model exhibited a sensitivity of 97.4\% with an average of 0.13 false-positives per slice.

In this thesis, we attempt to simplify the \textsc{cnn} developed by \cite{GhafoorianM.2017Dml3}. In particular, we apply soft tissue extraction on the data before input, we decrease the proportion of positive samples to 8.78\% of the total data set, and assess the performance of the model without false-positive reduction. The resulting model exhibits a testing sensitivity of 99.9\% and specificity of 99.8\%. Improving the sensitivity of the model ensures that all lacunes are being detected and the model is at least as sensitive to lacunes as a trained clinician. Training a model to this sensitivity becomes more difficult as it is dependent on the quality of the original responses. Improving model specificity minimises time spent checking the model results. A model with a very large number of false-positives may take just as long to check as rating a whole scan. Improvement in specificity may be achieved by applying a three-dimensional \textsc{cnn} to improve image context, or by inclusion of location-based variables. Note that both of these methods require additional data preprocessing before use in a data pipeline.

In Chapter 2, we introduce terminology surrounding \textsc{mri} and the structure of the brain. We formally define the biomakers involved in \textsc{svd} and how they are identified. We discuss current image rating methods and the need for automated image rating algorithms.

In Chapter 3, we introduce the structure of neural networks and discuss the choice of activation and cost functions. We show that the minimum of the cost function can be estimated using the Gradient Descent algorithm, and finally discuss methods that mitigate overfitting of the data.

In Chapter 4, we introduce convolutional neural networks for image classification tasks and outline techniques that improve training efficiency given a large number of variables.

In Chapter 5, we discuss the efficacy of existing models, outline the structure of the lacune identification model built by \cite{GhafoorianM.2017Dml3}, and outline the proposed changes to the model.

In Chapter 6, we describe the methods of data collection and the preprocessing applied to the collected scans. We also describe the methods of data sampling before model implementation.

In Chapter 7, we present the results of two \textsc{cnn}s. We test the significance of a greater proportion of negative samples during training, and determine the final testing sensitivity and specificity rates. We discuss the final behaviour of the model, including the characteristics of samples that incur model error.
