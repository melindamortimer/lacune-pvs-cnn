METHODS—: We developed a rating method for dilated Virchow–Robin spaces in 4 brain regions (centrum semiovale, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and mesencephalon) and tested its reliability in a total of 125 MRI scans from 2 population-based studies. Six investigators with varying levels of experience performed the ratings. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to determine intra- and interrater reliability. RESULTS—: Intrarater reliability was excellent for all 4 regions (intraclass correlation coefficient, >0.8). Interrater reliability was excellent for the centrum semiovale and hippocampus (intraclass correlation coefficient, >0.8) and good for the basal ganglia and mesencephalon (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.6–0.8). This did not differ between the cohorts or experience levels. CONCLUSIONS—: We describe a reliable rating method that can facilitate pathogenic and prognostic research on dilated Virchow–Robin spaces using MRI.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE—: Cerebral small-vessel disease is a major cause of cognitive impairment. Perivascular spaces (PvS) occur in small-vessel disease, but their relationship to cognitive impairment remains uncertain. One reason may be difficulty in distinguishing between lacunes and PvS. We determined the relationship between baseline PvS score and PvS volume with change in cognition over a 5-year follow-up. We compared this to the relationship between baseline lacune count and total lacune volume with cognition. In addition, we examined change in PvS volume over time. METHODS—: Data from the prospective SCANS study (St Georges Cognition and Neuroimaging in Stroke) of patients with symptomatic lacunar stroke and confluent leukoaraiosis were used (n=121). Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging was performed annually for 3 years and neuropsychological testing annually for 5 years. Lacunes were manually identified and distinguished from PvS. PvS were rated using a validated visual rating scale, and PvS volumes calculated using T1-weighted images. Linear mixed-effect models were used to determine the impact of PvS and lacunes on cognition. RESULTS—: Baseline PvS scores or volumes showed no association with cognitive indices. No change was detectable in PvS volumes over the 3 years. In contrast, baseline lacunes associated with all cognitive indices and predicted cognitive decline over the 5-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS—: Although a feature of small-vessel disease, PvS are not a predictor of cognitive decline, in contrast to lacunes. This study highlights the importance of carefully differentiating between lacunes and PvS in studies investigating vascular cognitive impairment.Stroke is published on behalf of the American Heart Association, Inc., by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Several magnetic resonance imaging markers have therefore emerged, providing new information on the diagnosis, progression, and mechanisms of small vessel disease. Yet, the reproducibility of these small vessel disease markers has received little attention despite being widely used in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. This review focuses on the main small vessel disease-related markers on magnetic resonance imaging including: white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, dilated perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain volume. The aim is to summarize, for each marker, what is currently known about: (1) its reproducibility in studies with a scan–rescan procedure either in single or multicenter settings; (2) the acquisition-related sources of variability; and, (3) the techniques used to minimize this variability. Based on the results, we discuss technical and other challenges that need to be overcome in order for these markers to be reliably used as outcome measures in future clinical trials. We also highlight the key points that need to be considered when designing multicenter magnetic resonance imaging studies of small vessel disease.",

They are commonly related to cerebral small vessel disease and associated with both stroke and dementia. We examined the spatial relationships between incident lacunes and white matter hyperintensities and related these findings to information on vascular anatomy to study possible mechanistic links between the two lesion types. Two hundred and seventy-six patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a genetically defined small vessel disease with mutations in the NOTCH3 gene were followed with magnetic resonance imaging over a total of 633 patient years. Using difference images and Jacobian maps from registered images we identified 104 incident lacunes. The majority ( n = 95; 91.3%) of lacunes developed at the edge of a white matter hyperintensity whereas few lacunes were found to develop fully within ( n = 6; 5.8%) or outside ( n = 3; 2.9%) white matter hyperintensities. Adding information on vascular anatomy revealed that the majority of incident lacunes developed proximal to a white matter hyperintensity along the course of perforating vessels supplying the respective brain region. We further studied the spatial relationship between prevalent lacunes and white matter hyperintensities both in 365 patients with CADASIL and in 588 elderly subjects from the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study. The results were consistent with the results for incident lacunes. Lesion prevalence maps in different disease stages showed a spread of lesions towards subcortical regions in both cohorts. Our findings suggest that the mechanisms of lacunes and white matter hyperintensities are intimately connected and identify the edge of white matter hyperintensities as a predilection site for lacunes. Our observations further support and refine the concept of the white matter hyperintensity penumbra.",

abstract = "Lacunes of presumed vascular origin (lacunes) are associated with an increased risk of stroke, gait impairment, and dementia and are a primary imaging feature of the small vessel disease. Quantification of lacunes may be of great importance to elucidate the mechanisms behind neuro-degenerative disorders and is recommended as part of study standards for small vessel disease research. However, due to the different appearance of lacunes in various brain regions and the existence of other similar-looking structures, such as perivascular spaces, manual annotation is a difficult, elaborative and subjective task, which can potentially be greatly improved by reliable and consistent computer-aided detection (CAD) routines. In this paper, we propose an automated two-stage method using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). We show that this method has good performance and can considerably benefit readers. We first use a fully convolutional neural network to detect initial candidates. In the second step, we employ a 3D CNN as a false positive reduction tool. As the location information is important to the analysis of candidate structures, we further equip the network with contextual information using multi-scale analysis and integration of explicit location features. We trained, validated and tested our networks on a large dataset of 1075 cases obtained from two different studies. Subsequently, we conducted an observer study with four trained observers and compared our method with them using a free-response operating characteristic analysis. Shown on a test set of 111 cases, the resulting CAD system exhibits performance similar to the trained human observers and achieves a sensitivity of 0.974 with 0.13 false positives per slice. A feasibility study also showed that a trained human observer would considerably benefit once aided by the CAD system.",

SVD is a systemic disease, probably related to diffuse endothelial dysfunction, which affects the perforating arterioles, capillaries and venules in the brain. Although often asymptomatic, it is responsible for almost half of all dementia cases and a significant proportion of stroke cases. Imaging features found on magnetic resonance include recent small subcortical infarctions, lacunes of presumed vascular origin, white matter hyperintensity of presumed vascular origin, prominent perivascular spaces and cerebral microbleeds. The recognition of these imaging findings as a spectrum of the same disease caused by endothelial dysfunction of small cerebral vessels can allow an overall analysis of the disease and thus the development of more effective preventive and therapeutic strategies.</p>",

Recent studies have shown that the prognosis after lacunar infarcts is not benign; the risk of recurrent stroke is no lower than for other ischaemic stroke subtypes, and there is an increased risk for cognitive decline, dementia and death in the long term. Furthermore, silent small vessel disease in the brain at the time of an index stroke has significant prognostic implications. In the acute phase, response to intravenous thrombolysis appears to be similar to other subtypes of ischaemic strokes.

abstract = "  Background: Perivascular spaces (PVS) are an important component of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), several inflammatory disorders, hypertension and blood-brain barrier breakdown, but are difficult to quantify. A recent international collaboration of SVD experts has highlighted the need for a robust, easy-to-use PVS rating scale for the effective investigation of the diagnostic and prognostic significance of PVS. The purpose of the current study was to develop and extend existing PVS scales to provide a more comprehensive scale for the measurement of PVS in the basal ganglia, centrum semiovale and midbrain, and to test its intra- and inter-rater agreement, assessing reasons for discrepancy. Methods: We reviewed previously published PVS scales, including site of PVS assessed, rating method, and size and morphological criteria. Retaining key features, we devised a more comprehensive scale in order to improve the reliability of PVS rating. Two neuroradiologists tested the new scale in MRI brain scans of 60 patients from two studies (stroke, ageing population), chosen to represent a full range of PVS, and demonstrating concomitant features of SVD such as lacunes and white matter hyperintensities. We rated basal ganglia, centrum semiovale, and midbrain PVS. Basal ganglia and centrum semiovale PVS were rated 0 (none), 1 (1-10), 2 (11-20), 3 (21-40) and 4 (>40), and midbrain PVS were rated 0 (none visible) or 1 (visible). We calculated kappa statistics for rating, assessed consistency in use of PVS categories (Bhapkar test) and reviewed sources of discrepancy. Results: Intra- and inter-rater kappa statistics were highest for basal ganglia PVS (range 0.76-0.87 and 0.8-0.9, respectively) than for centrum semiovale PVS (range 0.68-0.75 and 0.61-0.8, respectively) or midbrain PVS (inter-rater range 0.51-0.52). Inter-rater consistency was better for basal ganglia compared to centrum semiovale PVS (Bhapkar statistic 2.49-3.72, compared to 6.79-21.08, respectively). Most inter-rater disagreements were due to very faint PVS, coexisting extensive white matter hyperintensities (WMH) or the presence of lacunes. Conclusions: We developed a more inclusive and robust visual PVS rating scale allowing rating of all grades of PVS severity on structural brain imaging. The revised PVS rating scale has good observer reliability for basal ganglia and centrum semiovale PVS, best for basal ganglia PVS, and moderate reliability for midbrain PVS. Agreement is influenced by PVS severity and the presence of background features of SVD. The current scale can be used in further studies to assess the clinical implications of PVS. © 2015 S.

In this paper, improvements to this method are described, and also an extension of SIENA to a new method for cross-sectional (single time point) analysis. The methods are fully automated, robust, and accurate: 0.15% brain volume change error (longitudinal): 0.5-1% brain volume accuracy for single-time point (cross-sectional). A particular advantage is the relative insensitivity to differences in scanning parameters.

However, their accurate identification is often difficult task. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a computer-aided diagnosis scheme for the detection of lacunar infarcts. Our database consisted of 1,143 T1- and 1,143 T2-weighted images obtained from 132 patients. We first segmented the cerebral region in the T1- weighted image by using a region growing technique. For identifying the initial lacunar infarcts candidates, white top-hat transform and multiple-phase binarization were then applied to the T2- weighted image. For eliminating false positives (FPs), we determined 12 features, i.e., the locations x and y, density differences in the T1- and T2- weighted images, nodular components (NC), and nodular & linear components (NLC) from a scale 1 to 4. The NCs and NLCs were obtained using filter bank technique. The rule-based scheme and a neural network with 12 features were employed as the first step for eliminating FPs. The modular classifier was then used for eliminating three typical sources of FPs. As a result, the sensitivity of the detection of lacunar infarcts was 96.8% with 0.30 FP per image. Our computerized scheme would assist radiologists in identifying lacunar infarcts on MR images.},

abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE—: On cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and lacunes are generally viewed as evidence of small vessel disease. The clinical significance of small vessel disease in terms of global cognitive function has as yet not been completely clarified. We investigated the independent contribution of WMH and lacunes to general cognitive function in a group of independently living elderly with varying degrees of small vessel disease. METHODS—: Data were drawn from the multicenter, multinational Leukokraurosis and Disability (LADIS) study. There were 633 independently living participants. General cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the modified Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS). On MRI, WMH was rated as mild, moderate, or severe. Lacunes were rated as none, few (1 to 3), or many (4 or more). RESULTS—: In the basic analysis, increasing severity of both WMH and lacunes was related to deteriorating score on the MMSE and ADAS. When WMH and lacunes were entered simultaneously, both MRI measures remained significantly associated with MMSE score. Increasing severity of WMH remained associated with ADAS score, whereas the association with lacunes became less prominent. These associations were independent of other risk factors for dementia, like education, depression, vascular risk factors, or stroke. CONCLUSION—: We found WMH and lacunes to be independently associated with general cognitive function in a sample of independently living elderly. These results highlight the fact that WMH and lacunes should both be evaluated when assessing small vessel disease in relation to cognitive function.",

abstract = "Cerebral abnormalities such as white matter hyperintensity (WMH), cortical infarct (CI), and lacunar infarct (LI) are of clinical importance and frequently present in patients with stroke and dementia. Up to date, there are limited algorithms available to automatically delineate these cerebral abnormalities partially due to their complex appearance in MR images. In this paper, we describe an automated multi-stage segmentation approach for labeling the WMH, CI, and LI using multi-modal MR images. We first automatically segment brain tissues (white matter, gray matter, and CSF) based on the T1-weighted image and then identify hyperintense voxels based on the fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image. We finally label the WMH, CI, and LI based on the T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR images. The segmentation accuracy is evaluated using a community-based sample of 272 old adults. Our results show that the automated segmentation of the WMH, CI, and LI is comparable with manual labeling in terms of spatial location, volume, and the number of lacunes. Additionally, the WMH volume is highly correlated with the visual grading score based on the Age-Related White Matter Changes (ARWMC) protocol. The evaluations against the manual labeling and ARWMC visual grading suggest that our algorithm provides reasonable segmentation accuracy for the WMH, CI, and LI. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..",

abstract = "Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a common accompaniment of ageing. Features seen on neuroimaging include recent small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain atrophy. SVD can present as a stroke or cognitive decline, or can have few or no symptoms. SVD frequently coexists with neurodegenerative disease, and can exacerbate cognitive deficits, physical disabilities, and other symptoms of neurodegeneration. Terminology and definitions for imaging the features of SVD vary widely, which is also true for protocols for image acquisition and image analysis. This lack of consistency hampers progress in identifying the contribution of SVD to the pathophysiology and clinical features of common neurodegenerative diseases. We are an international working group from the Centres of Excellence in Neurodegeneration. We completed a structured process to develop definitions and imaging standards for markers and consequences of SVD. We aimed to achieve the following: first, to provide a common advisory about terms and definitions for features visible on MRI; second, to suggest minimum standards for image acquisition and analysis; third, to agree on standards for scientific reporting of changes related to SVD on neuroimaging; and fourth, to review emerging imaging methods for detection and quantification of preclinical manifestations of SVD. Our findings and recommendations apply to research studies, and can be used in the clinical setting to standardise image interpretation, acquisition, and reporting. This Position Paper summarises the main outcomes of this international effort to provide the STandards for ReportIng Vascular changes on nEuroimaging (STRIVE). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to develop a technique to detect lacunar infarct regions automatically in brain MR images. Our detection method is based on the definition of lacunar infarcts. After inputted images were binarized, we used feature values such as area, circularities and the center of gravity of candidate regions to extract isolated lacunar infarct regions. We also developed and used a new filter to enhance the signals of lacunar infarcts adjacent to some high intensity regions. 10 cases involving 81 sectional images were applied to our experiment. As a result, the sensitivity was 100% with approximately 1.77 false-positives per image. Our results are promising on the first stage, although it remains to improve on problems that to eliminate false-positives and automatically establish threshold value.},
