New methods of structural analysis attempt to improve robustness, accuracy, and extent of automation. A fully automated method of longitudinal (temporal change) analysis, SIENA, was presented previously. In this paper, improvements to this method are described, and also an extension of SIENA to a new method for cross-sectional (single time point) analysis. The methods are fully automated, robust, and accurate: 0.15% brain volume change error (longitudinal): 0.5-1% brain volume accuracy for single-time point (cross-sectional). A particular advantage is the relative insensitivity to differences in scanning parameters. The methods provide easy manual review of their output by the automatic production of summary images which show the results of the brain extraction, registration, tissue segmentation, and final atrophy estimation.",

abstract="Detection of lacunar infarcts is important because their presence indicates an increased risk of severe cerebral infarction. However, accurate identification is often hindered by the difficulty in distinguishing between lacunar infarcts and enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces. Therefore, we developed a computer-aided detection (CAD) scheme for the detection of lacunar infarcts. Although our previous CAD method indicated a sensitivity of 96.8 {\%} with 0.71 false positives (FPs) per slice, further reduction of FPs remained an issue for the clinical application. Thus, the purpose of this study is to improve our CAD scheme by using template matching in the eigenspace. Conventional template matching is useful for the reduction of FPs, but it has the following two pitfalls: (1) It needs to maintain a large number of templates to improve the detection performance, and (2) calculation of the cross-correlation coefficient with these templates is time consuming. To solve these problems, we used template matching in the lower dimension space made by a principal component analysis. Our database comprised 1,143 T1- and T2-weighted images obtained from 132 patients. The proposed method was evaluated by using twofold cross-validation. By using this method, 34.1 {\%} of FPs was eliminated compared with our previous method. The final performance indicated that the sensitivity of the detection of lacunar infarcts was 96.8 {\%} with 0.47 FPs per slice. Therefore, the modified CAD scheme could improve FP rate without a significant reduction in the true positive rate.",

However, their accurate identification is often difficult task. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a computer-aided diagnosis scheme for the detection of lacunar infarcts. Our database consisted of 1,143 T1- and 1,143 T2-weighted images obtained from 132 patients. We first segmented the cerebral region in the T1- weighted image by using a region growing technique. For identifying the initial lacunar infarcts candidates, white top-hat transform and multiple-phase binarization were then applied to the T2- weighted image. For eliminating false positives (FPs), we determined 12 features, i.e., the locations x and y, density differences in the T1- and T2- weighted images, nodular components (NC), and nodular & linear components (NLC) from a scale 1 to 4. The NCs and NLCs were obtained using filter bank technique. The rule-based scheme and a neural network with 12 features were employed as the first step for eliminating FPs. The modular classifier was then used for eliminating three typical sources of FPs. As a result, the sensitivity of the detection of lacunar infarcts was 96.8% with 0.30 FP per image. Our computerized scheme would assist radiologists in identifying lacunar infarcts on MR images.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE—: On cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and lacunes are generally viewed as evidence of small vessel disease. The clinical significance of small vessel disease in terms of global cognitive function has as yet not been completely clarified. We investigated the independent contribution of WMH and lacunes to general cognitive function in a group of independently living elderly with varying degrees of small vessel disease. METHODS—: Data were drawn from the multicenter, multinational Leukokraurosis and Disability (LADIS) study. There were 633 independently living participants. General cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the modified Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS). On MRI, WMH was rated as mild, moderate, or severe. Lacunes were rated as none, few (1 to 3), or many (4 or more). RESULTS—: In the basic analysis, increasing severity of both WMH and lacunes was related to deteriorating score on the MMSE and ADAS. When WMH and lacunes were entered simultaneously, both MRI measures remained significantly associated with MMSE score. Increasing severity of WMH remained associated with ADAS score, whereas the association with lacunes became less prominent. These associations were independent of other risk factors for dementia, like education, depression, vascular risk factors, or stroke. CONCLUSION—: We found WMH and lacunes to be independently associated with general cognitive function in a sample of independently living elderly. These results highlight the fact that WMH and lacunes should both be evaluated when assessing small vessel disease in relation to cognitive function.},

abstract = "Cerebral abnormalities such as white matter hyperintensity (WMH), cortical infarct (CI), and lacunar infarct (LI) are of clinical importance and frequently present in patients with stroke and dementia. Up to date, there are limited algorithms available to automatically delineate these cerebral abnormalities partially due to their complex appearance in MR images. In this paper, we describe an automated multi-stage segmentation approach for labeling the WMH, CI, and LI using multi-modal MR images. We first automatically segment brain tissues (white matter, gray matter, and CSF) based on the T1-weighted image and then identify hyperintense voxels based on the fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image. We finally label the WMH, CI, and LI based on the T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR images. The segmentation accuracy is evaluated using a community-based sample of 272 old adults. Our results show that the automated segmentation of the WMH, CI, and LI is comparable with manual labeling in terms of spatial location, volume, and the number of lacunes. Additionally, the WMH volume is highly correlated with the visual grading score based on the Age-Related White Matter Changes (ARWMC) protocol. The evaluations against the manual labeling and ARWMC visual grading suggest that our algorithm provides reasonable segmentation accuracy for the WMH, CI, and LI. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..",

abstract = "Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a common accompaniment of ageing. Features seen on neuroimaging include recent small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain atrophy. SVD can present as a stroke or cognitive decline, or can have few or no symptoms. SVD frequently coexists with neurodegenerative disease, and can exacerbate cognitive deficits, physical disabilities, and other symptoms of neurodegeneration. Terminology and definitions for imaging the features of SVD vary widely, which is also true for protocols for image acquisition and image analysis. This lack of consistency hampers progress in identifying the contribution of SVD to the pathophysiology and clinical features of common neurodegenerative diseases. We are an international working group from the Centres of Excellence in Neurodegeneration. We completed a structured process to develop definitions and imaging standards for markers and consequences of SVD. We aimed to achieve the following: first, to provide a common advisory about terms and definitions for features visible on MRI; second, to suggest minimum standards for image acquisition and analysis; third, to agree on standards for scientific reporting of changes related to SVD on neuroimaging; and fourth, to review emerging imaging methods for detection and quantification of preclinical manifestations of SVD. Our findings and recommendations apply to research studies, and can be used in the clinical setting to standardise image interpretation, acquisition, and reporting. This Position Paper summarises the main outcomes of this international effort to provide the STandards for ReportIng Vascular changes on nEuroimaging (STRIVE). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to develop a technique to detect lacunar infarct regions automatically in brain MR images. Our detection method is based on the definition of lacunar infarcts. After inputted images were binarized, we used feature values such as area, circularities and the center of gravity of candidate regions to extract isolated lacunar infarct regions. We also developed and used a new filter to enhance the signals of lacunar infarcts adjacent to some high intensity regions. 10 cases involving 81 sectional images were applied to our experiment. As a result, the sensitivity was 100% with approximately 1.77 false-positives per image. Our results are promising on the first stage, although it remains to improve on problems that to eliminate false-positives and automatically establish threshold value.},
