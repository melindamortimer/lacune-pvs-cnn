 - read multivariate lecture
 - examine model code. How to structure data to fit? Even write some pseudo-code
 - Read uchiyama2007a paper and continue literature review
 - tax return


Project:
 - Go through images & spreadsheet. Determine x,y,z of lacunes. Ask Wei for help if necessary.

Thesis:
 - Research backpropagation algorithm - finds the local minimum, not global. But that is good enough for this project.
 - Convolution section: algorithm + pooling
 - Check section on cost functions - advantages of ReLU
 - Add some MRI images, when data comes through
 - literature review: Mention some other techniques - statistical and machine learning - why wouldn’t they work? Known that results are not very successful? Mention that time constraints mean that they won’t be implemented for this study; but it’s known that their accuracy is ___. NOTE statistical methods more prominent in micro bleed detection attempts than lacunes. Details in microbleed CNN paper.
 - In neural network equations, express the entire network using composite functions - shown in DeepTriangle.pdf P3 (Readings folder)
 - Justify tools: why did I choose tensorflow with R? Vs straight Python. Not kerbs? Pierre’s website lists common tools.

QUESTIONS:
 - Thesis NNet background: How to structure outline of notation?


	

TO WRITE:

Intro: Brief results. Will talk about what each section is.

Background on brains and lacunes in MRI. First, the brain - structures in general, and those that are scanned/visible in MRI. The types of imaging: T1, T2, Flair. Show images!
Lacunes and perivascular spaces. Rough definitions, hypothesised causes and societal impacts.
Current rating methods: manual identification and automation.
Identification standards: STRIVE criterion. Include images of what raters look for. Try to find lacunes and perivascular spaces in MRI. Current success rates using this criterion.
Introduce the idea of automated detection. Attempts at identifying microbleeds and lacunes. Briefly describe methods and success rates.

Research and understand the workings of Neural networks, convolutional neural networks and 3D CNNs. Understand the mathematics behind them - collect equations. Note the regression functions used.

Lacune CNN paper literature review.
